	<h2><abbr>FAQ</abbr></h2>

	<h3>What is this?</h3>
	<p>Babelacc is an interactive tool to compare different implementations of
	the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/">Accessible Name and
	Description Computation</a>. It can be used by developers of these tools to
	find incompatibilities. It can also be used by web authors to check their
	content.</p>

	<h3>Testing manually is tedious. Is there an automated test suite I can use?</h3>
	<p>An automated test suite is planned. You can checkout the current version
	at <a href="https://github.com/xi/accname-test">xi/accname-test</a>. You can
	help improving it by finding interesting test cases on this page.</p>

	<h3>I also implemented this algorithm. Can you add my implementation?</h3>
	<p>Sure! Just create a <a href="https://github.com/xi/babelacc/pulls">pull request</a>.</p>

	<h3>Why is the output of real browsers not included in the comparison?</h3>
	<p>The output of real browsers is actually more important than all of
	these tools. We would love to include it, but that is not that easy. If you
	have an idea how that could be done, feel free to submit a <a href="https://github.com/xi/babelacc/pulls">pull request</a>.</p>
	<p>Also note that the code is rendered below the list of results. So if you
	have assitive technologoes available you can check the output there.</p>

	<h3>I found an interesting case where implementations do not agree. What should I do with it?</h3>
	<p>Awesome! Please create a <a href="https://github.com/xi/accname-test/pulls">pull request</a> so we can include this case in our test suite.</p>
